# BattleShip
This is Battleship! A recreation of the classic board game.

## Background
This is Battleship! A recreation of the classic board game, and my final project for my high school computer programming class in 2015. That class inspired my love of software development and is the reason I went into Computer Science. I was, and still am, very proud of this project. I needed to go above and beyond the material covered in the course and do a lot of learning on my own to complete it, which is probably one of the most valuable skills I learned for my future in CS. I've always loved board games and computer games, and recreating a board game as a computer program was incredibly fun and rewarding. 

## Changes Made
I thought I had lost this project years ago when I had a hard drive die, but recently discovered it on a flash drive. Unfortunately, the `Form1.Designer.vb` file was empty so the UI elements were missing. I re-added them and changed a few of the components as the old ones were deprecated in newer versions of Visual Studio. However, all of the original logic of the game I wrote in 2015 was still present in the `Form1.vb` file and has not been updated.

## To Run
To play Battleship you can download this project, navigate to `/bin/release/` and run `BattleShip.exe`. Good luck!
